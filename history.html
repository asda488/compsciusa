		<h2 class="headingtext">Early History</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">The USA was originally inhabited by Native Americans, who have today lost the majority of their former territory.
		<br>However, the first Western enroachment was by Christopher Columbus, who found America in 1492, followed by other Europeans, and eventually,
		<br>the Mayflower launched in 1620, one of the first settlers of the what we now call the United States of America. Other British settlers followed,
		<br>founding in total 13 American colonies with different ideals and laws, bartering with the local tribes as well as other European settlers.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 class="headingtext">Independence</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">In 1754, fighting erupted between French and English Colonies, known as the French and Indian War, uniting the colonies into
		<br>one entity. However, in the years to pass, the British parliament started to tax and suppress the colonies, thereby giving the motto "No taxation without representation",
		<br>and casuing events like the Boston Tea Party, wherein settlers dumped taxed, imported tea over board on docked ships from England and British colonies.
		<br>War broke out once again in April 1775 when the British attempted to arrest the leaders of the colonies. The US were very sucessful, capturing the British main force and recruiting France
		<br>and Spain to its cause. The USA was declared independent in July 1776, however the war was not ended until a treaty was signed in September 1783.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 class="headingtext">The Republic and Civil War</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">The USA now existed as a republic, with some of its most famous presidents governing within this time, like George Washington,
		<br>and Thomas Jefferson. However challenges were made to the US government, like Native American revolts and French and Dutch attacks, and also the war of 1812
		<br>against British and Native American forces. This was also accompanied in the later years by a rapid growth of territory, mostly westwards. Round about 1850, 
		<br>the north and south started seperating in political and ethical views, most famously about slavery, ultimately building up to the American Civil War, 
		<br>where the North formed the Union, and the south the Confederacy, with the first battle being on April 12, 1861. Lead by Abraham Lincoln, the Union did suffer a couple of setbacks, however eventually
		<br>prevailed over the Confederacy, with a treaty being signed at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.</p>	
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 class="headingtext">Gilded Age and WWI</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">After the war, the USA entered a period of industrialisation with strikes, factories, railroads and general improvments of 
		<br>rights for poor people and women, emerging out the other side in 1890 as a global superpower and an imperialist philosophy, like their forerunners, 
		<br>the British. However, not all was settled, with the outbreak of World War One, but the USA did not enter until a threat from Germany, in April 1917.
		<br>This mostly resulted in an Allied victory.</p>
		
		<br>

		<h2 class="headingtext">The Great Depression and Modern Age</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">Directly after WWI, the USA entered a period of depression, triggered by the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and other factors.
		<br>While the USA was dealing with its own problems, dictators sprung up in different countries, helping to trigger World War Two. Famously, the
		<br>US did not enter until the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, with the USA helping with troops and also the Manhattan project, eventually dropping
		<br>two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and forcing the surrender of Japan after Germany. After World War Two, the US had good relation
		<br>with all Allies, with the exception of Russia. This eventually lead to the Cold War, with no fighting but opposing political ideologies,
		<br>the peak being the Cuban missile crisis, but defusing after. The USA we see nowadays was shaped by a combination of all these political factors.</p>
