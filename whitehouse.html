		<h2 class="headingtext">Early residences</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">Multiple early residences for the president were built. The first of these houses was the Samuel Osgood house, in Manhattan, New York. 
		<br>It was used as the first presidental house, by George Washington from April 1789 to February 1790, after his famous inauguration. 
		<br>It was also named after the existing Treasury Commissioner at the time, Samuel Osgood. It was known as the First Presidential Mansion.</p>

		<p class="paragraphtext">The president then moved into a bigger house called the Alexander Macomb House, named after the Irish trader who built the house.
		<br>It was located at 39-41 Broadway, and was manned by a small selection of staff. Washington stayed there until August 1790.</p>

		<p class="paragraphtext">Beginning in May 1790, New York started constructing a permanent house for the President, called the Government House.
		<br>However, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia in Pennsylvania before the house was constructed, so no president ever lived there.</p>

		<p class="paragraphtext">After the national capital was temporarily moved to Philadelphia, the house of merchant Robert Morris was rented for the President,
		<br>calling it the President's House while Washington lived there from November 1790 to March 1797 with 30 staff and servants.</p>

		<p class="paragraphtext">Like New York, Philadelphia also began constructing a house for the President, but the president at the time of completion declined to inhabit it.
		<br>It was later sold to the city's university, around the time when the capital was moved to Washington D.C (District of Columbia)</p>

		<h2 class="headingtext">The White House</h2>
		
		<p class="paragraphtext">The building most associated with the president of the USA however, is the iconic White House. Built of white
		<br>painted locally sourced Aquia Creek sandstone, it stands at a hefty 5,500m&sup2;, roughly the size of 2 or 3
		<br>supermarkets. It was built by James Hoban, an Irish architect, from 1792 to 1800.</p>
